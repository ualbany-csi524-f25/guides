# Fusion Installation for Apple Silicon Machines

- [Step 1: Set Up the Host Apple Machine](#setup-host)
- [Step 2: Install VMWare Fusion Player](#install-fusion)

## <a id="setup-host"></a>Step 1: Set Up the Host Apple Machine

We need to install some software packages on the host Apple machine. 
To do that, we first need to install Homebrew, which
is a package manager for macOS (and Linux, too).
We assume that you already have docker 
installed on your Apple machine. If you don't have it, 
please follow [these instructions](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/).

### Step 1.1: Install Homebrew

To install Homebrew, open the terminal and run the following command.

```/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"```

If you get this error: ```xcode-select: error:
invalid developer directory '/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools'``` during the installation,
this is because your `Xcode` is not installed or set up properly,
so ```/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools``` is not a valid directory for ```xcode-select```.

You can run the following command in the terminal to further confirm that
there is no active developer directory.

```xcode-select -p```

![error: no-active-directory](./Figs/error-no-active-directory.png)

To solve the problem, you run the following command in the terminal to 
install `xcode-select`:

```xcode-select --install```

If after installing homebrew you are not able to access brew, run the following command in the terminal.

```echo 'eval $(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)' >> ~/.zprofile```

```eval $(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)```

## <a id="install-fusion"></a>Step 2: Install VMware Fusion Player

VMware Fusion Player is a free virtual machine software. 
It is similar to VirtualBox that we have been using 
for the SEED labs, but VirtualBox still cannot run 
reliably on Apple Silicon machines. 

Go to [VMware Fusion](https://customerconnect.vmware.com/en/evalcenter?p=fusion-player-personal-13) and either log in or register for a basic Broadcom account.

You will get this page when you registered successfully. You can skip `Build my Profile` for now.

Once logged in Broadcom account, we come back to [Broadcom Support Portal](https://support.broadcom.com/web/ecx/home) if we're not redirected there. We click the `Software` dropdown to choose the `VMware Cloud Foundation division` to select `My Downloads`.

After the installation is finished, you can start the VMware Fusion Player. 

You will be asked to enter license key. Select `VMware Fusion Pro for Personal Use`.

You will be asked to allow the kernel extensions. Click on `Open Security Preferences`.

In the Security & Privacy settings, click on `Allow` to allow the kernel extensions.
